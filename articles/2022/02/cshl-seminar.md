I gave an invited talk on my research on building energy efficient computers at Cold Spring Harbor Labs (CSHL). This was a fun opportunity, and I greatly enjoyed the feedback and discussion. You can find my talk slides [here](/assets/publications/CSHL NeuroAI Seminar - Slides.pdf) (note that the future work sections have been removed since they include ongoing proposals).
