A lot of my work at CSHL involve thinking how to embed structure into neural networks in a principled and controllable manner. This work does just that, taking inspiration from neuromodulation! We built not a single neural network, but a topologically contrained ensemble that learns concurrently. Check it out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22994)!
