    I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at UW-Madison!

I defended my thesis on _Building Energy Efficient Computers with Brain-Inspired Computing Models_ (I plan to upload a "pretty" copy of the PDF soon). After a long break from research, I'll be starting as a NeuroAI Scholar at Cold Spring Harbor Lab in August! I'm very excited to be working in a collaborative environment with _real neuroscientists_. Please contact me if you think we can have an interesting collaboration!
