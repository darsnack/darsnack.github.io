    Our work on tracking facial movements in mice using 3D pose estimation is now on bioRxiv.

I'm excited to share the first bit of work from my time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In an effort to learn neuroscience through osmosis, I've been collaborating with the [Hou Lab](https://www.houlab.org) to study facial movements in mice. In comparison to other behaviors, facial movements cover a wide spatial and temporal dynamic range, and in this work, we carefully developed a 3D pose estimation pipeline that is accurate and robust across these spatiotemporal scales. Read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.07.593051v1.full.pdf), and contact us if you're interested in using our method!
