@def title = "About me"

Hello, everyone! My name is Kyle Daruwalla, and I am a PhD student at University of Wisconsin â€” Madison. I study under [Dr. Mikko Lipasti](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu/mikko/) in the [PHARM group](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu). For my undergraduate studies, I went to [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu) for electrical engineering and mathematics.

Getting the *important* stuff out of the way, below are some pictures of my dog, George. He also goes by Jorge or Lil' Bubba.

My research interests include neuromorphic computing, biological learning, and ultra-low power computing paradigms. I have experience with computer architecture, ML, RTL design, and IC layout. I also teach (as a TA) undergrad and grad courses on embedded systems, PCB layout, optimization, and linear algebra for ML. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

Away from engineering hall, George and I enjoy hiking, sailing, and playing guitar (Jorge plays the part of snoring).
