@def title = "About me"

Hello, everyone! My name is Kyle Daruwalla, and I am a NeuroAI scholar at [Cold Spring Harbor Lab](https://www.cshl.edu) in Long Island, NY. I completed my PhD at University of Wisconsin-Madison under [Dr. Mikko Lipasti](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu/mikko/) in the [PHARM group](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu). For my undergraduate studies, I went to [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu) for electrical engineering and mathematics.

Getting the *important* stuff out of the way, below are some pictures of my dog, George. He also goes by Jorge or Lil' Bubba.

My research interests include neuromorphic computing, biological learning, and ultra-low power computing paradigms. I have experience with computer architecture, ML, RTL design, and IC layout. I also taught (as a TA and instructor) undergrad and grad courses on computer engineering, embedded systems, PCB layout, optimization, and linear algebra for ML.
**You can find my full CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).**

Service and shared governance is important to me. I have dedicate my energy and time to elevating graduate student voices on campus, particularly in my own department. I have served as president, vice-president, and PR officer for our department's graduate student association. I also served on the Graduate School's Dean's Advisory Board, and I was a departmental steward for the [TAA](https://taa-madison.org). Email me if you want to discuss the importance of shared involvement in academia!

I also contribute to the [Julia language](https://julialang.org) community. I'm a core maintainer for [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl), [Metalhead.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl), [ParameterSchedulers.jl](https://github.com/darsnack/ParameterSchedulers.jl) and [BitSAD.jl](https://github.com/UW-PHARM/BitSAD.jl) (and I review/contribute to many other ML related packages). I help lead the [ML community team](https://github.com/FluxML/ML-Coordination-Tracker) with [Brian Chen](https://github.com/ToucheSir) and [Lorenz Ohly](https://github.com/lorenzoh). If you are interested in getting involved with open source, email me!

Away from the office, George and I enjoy hiking, sailing, and playing guitar (Jorge plays the part of snoring). I try to cook, eat, garden, or woodwork to get a good work-life balance.
