@def title = "About me"

Hello, everyone! My name is Kyle Daruwalla, and I am a NeuroAI scholar at [Cold Spring Harbor Lab](https://www.cshl.edu) in Long Island, NY. I completed my PhD at University of Wisconsin-Madison under [Dr. Mikko Lipasti](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu/mikko/) in the [PHARM group](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu). For my undergraduate studies, I went to [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu) for electrical engineering and mathematics.

Getting the *important* stuff out of the way, below are some pictures of my dog, George. He also goes by Jorge or Lil' Bubba.

My research interests include non-von Neumman computing paradigms, particularly those inspired by biology. Secretly, I want to revive [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#First_wave) which represents the last time when the lines between computer science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence were truly blurred. I have experience with computer architecture, ML, RTL design, and IC layout. I also taught (as a TA and instructor) undergrad and grad courses on computer engineering, embedded systems, PCB layout, optimization, and linear algebra for ML.
**You can find my full CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).**

Service and shared governance is important to me. I have dedicate my energy and time to elevating graduate student voices on campus, particularly in my own department. I have served as president, vice-president, and PR officer for our department's graduate student association. I also served on the Graduate School's Dean's Advisory Board, and I was a departmental steward for the [TAA](https://taa-madison.org). Email me if you want to discuss the importance of shared involvement in academia!

I also contribute to the [Julia language](https://julialang.org) community. I'm a maintainer for [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl), [Metalhead.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl), [ParameterSchedulers.jl](https://github.com/darsnack/ParameterSchedulers.jl) and [BitSAD.jl](https://github.com/UW-PHARM/BitSAD.jl) (and I review/contribute to many other ML related packages in the FluxML organization). If you are interested in getting involved with open source, email me!

Away from the office, George and I enjoy hiking, sailing, and playing guitar (Jorge plays the part of snoring). I try to cook, eat, garden, or woodwork to get a good work-life balance.
